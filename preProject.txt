// pre-project plan

the game is guessing the word and every time you fail some language disappears 
and if u got a letter right it showed be shown where it is on the empty square

this web is made with 4 sections:
the first sections we will call it start empty
the second section will be started 
the third will be completed-win
the forth will be completed-lose

1-start empty:
will have a header and a paragraph describing the game.
and lets say lis for the language selection.
and an empty square for the game
and then letters from a to z 

2-started:
will have the same features as the start empty section
but the difference will be when u click a letter and get it wrong a message will appear
under the paragraph that says farewell html for example 
and the words in the list will be disabled and have a skull on it and the game will progress

3-completed-win:
will show the completed word and a win message
that says 'you win!' and on another line 'well done!'
and a restart button

4-completed-lose:
will show the completed word and a lose message
that says 'Game Over!' and on another line 'you lose! better start learning Assembly'
and a restart button
